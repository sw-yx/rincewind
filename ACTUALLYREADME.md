# notes to contributors

dont edit the toplevel readme - the project readme is maintained in `/packages/rincewind/README.md` and copied out to the top level at publish time.

we do this so that npm.im/rincewind will always have a decent readme available, but when people land on github.com/sw-yx/rincewind they also have a nice readme.
